- Handle failure to connect to chess engine, in case Apple moves it again, or removes it, or whatever.
- Figure out what's the deal with Sjeng's `st` command, which doesn't seem to have any effect any more.
- Sjeng help doesn't show `easy` as a command -- should I remove that as well?
- Is there a way to configure Sjeng without having to put the `sjeng.rc` file in the home directory?
- Does Sjeng's `sd` command still work?  It seems to be playing pretty strong even when I limit depth to 1.
- My `NSTimer` workaround forces Sjeng to play fast, but it always plays the French Defense.
