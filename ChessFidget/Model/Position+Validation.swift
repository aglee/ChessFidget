Stages of move validation:

- **STAGE 1: Sanity-checking the fromSquare.**  Does the fromSquare contain a piece belonging to the player whose turn it is?
- **STAGE 2: Sanity-checking the toSquare.**  Is the toSquare a valid destination, ignoring whether it would violate king-vulnerability rules?
	- Each piece type has:
		- Zero or more "move vectors", which are pairs of the form (deltaX, deltaY).  Only Pawn has zero move vectors.
		- A flag indicating whether the piece can repeat its move vectors (true for Bishop, Rook, Queen; false for Pawn, Knight, King, though moot in the case of Pawn, which has no move vectors).
	- Special cases:
		- If the moving piece is a pawn, ANY of the following must be true:
			- It's a one-square advance into an empty square.
			- It's a two-square advance from the pawn's home square, not blocked by any pieces.
			- It's a capture, meaning ALL of the following are true:
				- The toSquare is one square ahead of fromSquare and one file away in either direction.
				- ANY of the following is true:
					- It's a plain diagonal capture: the toSquare contains a piece belonging to the opponent.
					- It's a capture en passant, meaning ALL the following are true:
						- The position's enPassantableSquare is non-nil.  (Note this implies the toSquare is empty, so we don't have to check that, though we could assert it if we want to be defensive.)
						- The toSquare is one rank ahead of the EP square.
						- The EP square is on the same rank as the fromSquare and one file away in either direction.
				- The toSquare is just ahead of the enPassantableSquare.
		- Castling:
			- It's a king-side castle.
			- It's a queen-side castle.
	- Check move vectors -- passes if ALL of the following are true:
		- The toSquare does not contain a piece belonging to the current player.
		- There is a path from fromSquare to toSquare along one of the piece's move vectors.
		- All squares on that path, excluding toSquare, are empty.
- **STAGE 3: Checking king-vulnerability.**  Would the move violate king-vulnerability rules?
	- The resulting position would not leave the king in check.
	- If it's a castle, ALL of the following must be true:
		- The king is not currently in check.
		- The king would not cross any squares attacked by the opponent.
- **STAGE 4: Specifying piece type for promotion.**
