 * Wrapper around an instance of MBCEngine.  Why add this layer of indirection?
 * Mainly to make bridging with Swift easier.  ChessEngineWrapper.h is easily
 * #imported in ChessFidget-Bridging-Header.h without my having to fix a bunch
 * of compiler errors.

 * Communicates with the backend chess engine via NSNotifications.  Posts
 * notifications to send commands to the backend engine.  Observes notifications
