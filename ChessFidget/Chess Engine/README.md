# Sjeng chess engine

The code in this directory is a tweaked and trimmed-down excerpt of Apple's code for Chess.app version 3.13.  These files implement the interface to the sjeng chess engine.

You can browse Apple's Chess.app source code at <http://opensource.apple.com/source/Chess/Chess-318/>.  A tarball of that source, including the source for sjeng, is included here.  It was downloaded from <https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/Chess/>.
